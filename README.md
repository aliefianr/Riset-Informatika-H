# ðŸ§  Deteksi Tumor Otak menggunakan Vision Transformer (ViT)
# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection using Vision Transformer (ViT) 

A deep learning project for classifying **brain tumor MRI images** into **tumor** and **non-tumor** categories using the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** architecture.  
This repository is part of an undergraduate research project at **Universitas Pembangunan Nasional "Veteran" Jawa Timur (UPN Jatim)**.

## ðŸ“– Overview

Brain tumors are one of the most severe neurological diseases that require early and accurate diagnosis.  
Recent advancements in **Deep Learning**â€”particularly **Transformer-based architectures**â€”have shown promising results in computer vision tasks.  

This research implements and evaluates a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model to classify MRI brain images into:
- ðŸ§© **Tumor**
- ðŸš« **Non-Tumor**

and compares its performance against conventional **CNN-based architectures**.

## ðŸ§¬ Research Objectives

- To **analyze the performance** of ViT in detecting brain tumors from MRI images.  
- To **compare** ViT with traditional CNN models in terms of accuracy and efficiency.  
- To **evaluate** the impact of **data augmentation** on ViT performance.  
- To **visualize interpretability** using attention maps from the Transformer model.
